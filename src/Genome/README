Genome sequencing

The ideal goal is to determine the shortest common superstring of a set of sequencing reads.

NOTE: This example assumes reads come from FASTA formatted files.

Steps are described in the Coursera course "Algorithms for DNA Sequencing" at Johns Hopkins University

1. Extract all k-mers from all sequencing reads. Keep a data structure of all reads that each k-mer was seen in.
2. Use the data structure to create a candidate list of all read pairs with a k-mer in common
3. Test each candidate read pair and build an adjascency graph from all read pairs that overlap.
(A read pair overlaps if some suffix of the first is a prefix of the second)
4. Determine the contigs
 a) Trace all paths through the adjasency graph
 b) For each path, assemble the contig by merging the suffix of each node with the overlapping prefix of the next
