        <h3>Convolutional Neural Network: Bird Species Classifier</h3>

        <h6>Summary</h6>
        <p>
            The goal is to produce a classification model which predicts the species given an image of a bird.
            The model is a convolutional neural network. It is possible to reach high accuracy in relatively short time
            by taking advantage of transfer learning.
        </p>
        <p>
            The species are selected as ones that are common in Southern Zrizona as this project was supported by
            the <a href="tucsonbirds.org">Tucson Bird Count</a>. The list started as a subset of the
            <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gpiosenka/100-bird-species">200 Birds Species</a> by removing ones that
            have not been detected in that region. Common species from the Bird Count dataset were then added.
        </p>
        <h3>Model Development</h3>
        <p>In Keras it is straightforward to fine tune the standard Inception V3 network using transfer learning.
             Load the standard Inception V3 backbone but replace the top layer with a combination of Pooling
            followed by densely connected layers to produce one prediction score per species. </p>
        <p>The dataset contains 16435 images across 110 species. That set is augmented by randomly adjusting
            zoom level and brightness, allowing a slight rotation and a horizontal flip. Train with batch size of 32,
            reserving 20% of the images at each step for validation. Accuracy converges after only two epochs.</p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>A subset of 639 images is held out from training so the model can be tested realistically. Species predictions
            of those images are compared to the actual, known labels to compute
        the model's average precision, recall and F1 score</p>
        <table class="table">
            <tr>
                <th>Precision</th>
                <th>Recall</th>
                <th>F1 Score</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td align="center">97.5%</td>
                <td align="center">97.6%</td>
                <td align="center">97.3%</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        <h3>Application</h3>
        To support real-world testing, it is convenient to have a Flask web app because it lets a wider range of people
        upload their own images and compare results to their own identification. This process can also find new species
        that should be added to the model.
