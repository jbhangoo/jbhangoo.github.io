    <h3>Genome Assembly and Alignment</h3>

    <h6>Summary</h6>
    <p>
        These examples were generated from exercises for Coursera classes
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/dna-sequencing">Algorithms for DNA Sequencing</a> and
        <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/genome-sequencing?specialization=bioinformatic">Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)</a>
    </p>

    <h6>Assembly</h6>
    <p>
        Two method of Overlapping Reads is implemented and the DeBruijn Network method is planned for the future.
    </p>
    <p>Summary of the overlapping reads method
        <pre>
        1. Extract all k-mers from all sequencing reads. Keep a data structure of all reads that each k-mer was seen in.
        2. Use the data structure to create a candidate list of all read pairs with a k-mer in common
        3. Test each candidate read pair and build an adjascency graph from all read pairs that overlap.
        (A read pair overlaps if some suffix of the first is a prefix of the second)
        4. Determine the contigs
        a) Trace all paths through the adjasency graph
        b) For each path, assemble the contig by merging the suffix of each node with the overlapping prefix of the next
